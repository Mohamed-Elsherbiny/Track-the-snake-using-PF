# Track-the-snake-using-PF
The goal of this project is to implement a simple particle filter with Matlab.

A snake, 12 pixels long and with a thickness of one pixel, is moving in a plan 200 x 200 pixels wide. The snake is red and the background is green. An images sequence (numbered according to time t) showing snake moves is recorded in the folder snake.zip. The goal is to detect and track the snake in the image during the whole sequence.
